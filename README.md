# Inequality and stereotypes

This will be some code that works with data in inequality and 
stereotypes, and builds some models of the emergence of inequality.

This serves as a prototype/proof-of-concept 
to support my NSF SPRF grant proposal.

to install Dallinger, which will run the online behavioral experiment.


## Data-driven regression analysis of gender pay gap and 

Below is a simple first analysis with easy-to-find data as a proof-of-concept
regarding the idea to connect bias in semantic representations to 
the gender pay gap. 


### Data provenance
- I obtained the 
  [pay gap data from the OECD on data.world](https://data.world/oecd/gender-wage-gap).
- I read the values for bias off the plots in Garg, et al., (2018).


## The model

We want to understand more about how much average and cumulative payoffs 
increase for women as harmful stereotype prevalence decreases. As harmful
stereotypes change, the
